oneseismic-scan
===============
Understand seismic cube identity and layout.

Scan a SEG-Y and understand its shape and layout for in preparation for
onseisemic storage. The scan program writes a metadata file to be used in the
next step of the ingestion pipeline. In addition to determining the layout of
data, a unique identifier (from sha1) is computed.

The output of this program is used as input to the next step in oneseismic
upload.

For 3D inline sorted post stack volumes with standard header layout (SEG-Y rev1
or later), no options or configuration should required. By inline sorting it is
understood that the inline is that last header word to change when reading
headers sequentially.

oneseismic-scan applies the terms primary-word and secondary-word to what in
inline-sorted cubes are inline and crossline respecitvely. Consider these headers:

::

    { 189: 1, 193: 1 }
    { 189: 1, 193: 2 }
    { 189: 1, 193: 3 }
    { 189: 2, 193: 1 }
    { 189: 2, 193: 2 }
    { 189: 2, 193: 3 }

Here 189 is the primary-word and 193 is the secondary-word. If the headers were
flipped like this, then 193 would be the primary-word and 189 the
secondary-word:

::

    { 189: 1, 193: 1 }
    { 189: 2, 193: 1 }
    { 189: 3, 193: 1 }
    { 189: 1, 193: 2 }
    { 189: 2, 193: 2 }
    { 189: 3, 193: 2 }

No particular signifiance is given to either orientiation, but oneseismic-scan
requires primary-word to be the last dimension to wrap around.
